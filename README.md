# ATTENDENCE-SYSTEM

1. in microsoft teams, downloading the attendance and manually calculating the presentees and absentees can get quite boring. I have tried to create a simple automation of the same.
2. in the downloaded sample daily attendance file, the first column consists of the student roll number, second user action and third is timestamp
3. i have extracted the first column, removed the duplications due to constant exit and joining of the students. compared it with an actual student list and created 
    the output as total presentees, girls and boys present and the actual roll numbers of the present students.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
1. I have added two excel csv sheets - one sample daily attendance(book2) and one actual student list. i created this for my mother who is a teacher so i naturally had to
 conceal the actual student details and filled them with roll number from 3100-3121 and their names as A to U. 
2. Install all the libraries properly for the code to function
3. the output will be a small tkinter gui window which will give you the output as mentioned in first section. i have also included a mailing feature which will send the mail at
   the desired recipient address for future use and data collection.
